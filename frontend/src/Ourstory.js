              What started as a small collection of houseplants in our living room quickly blossomed into a thriving business. 
              We found ourselves captivated by the vibrant colors, unique textures, and calming presence of plants. Friends and
               family often sought our advice on plant care and selection, and it became evident that there was a shared 
               enthusiasm for all things green.

                    At Chaperone, we believe that every plant tells a story. We are dedicated to sourcing our plants
                     from sustainable growers who share our commitment to the environment. Our pots are carefully chosen not
                      just for their aesthetic appeal but also for their quality and sustainability.
