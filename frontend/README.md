In this Project I did a Nav bar where I used react-router to navigate I did the Plants & pots Page where there is a search bar
where you can find the product you want when you type the name of the product.

And there are two buttons plant and pots where it will help you to filter between plants and pots

And I used Pagination while displaying the products and when you click on add cart it will give a popup saying congratulations and when you click on viw details it will say thank you 

And I did a footer with all the details that was mentioned in Figma

And lastly this is responsive it will be according to the device that you are using.
